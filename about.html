<h2>Why this site exists?</h2>

<p><b>The DX discussed here is mostly related to APIs and Platform Economy.</b></p>

<p>Most of the 100 Days of Developer eXperience posts are combination of empirical quotes from developers and facts from scientific articles. </p>

<p>I've been writing a new book called <b>Build for Developers</b> for several months already. I had to build a habbit of writing 
at least something every day. First I tried to write one hour every day. That was overwhelming and I failed.</p>

<p>Now I write every day a short (around 500 words) post about Developer eXperience. All the content probably helps in writing the book as well.</p>

<h2>Why 100 days?</h2> 

<p>I noticed a friend of mine doing 100 designs challenge or something like that. I thought to try same thing with DX and writing.</p>

<h2>You can suggest topics</h2>

<p>You can suggest topics for future posts by raising an issue in Github - <a href="https://github.com/kyyberi/100daysofDX/issues/new">I have an idea!</a>. I will not promise to write about your suggestion, but I promise to consider it thoroughly. </p>


<h2>What happens after 100 days?</h2>

<p>
I might be exhausted, but mostly likely I have learned a lot about DX and writing. 
At the same time, the 100 days acts as counter to book "Build for Developers" publishing. Aim is that after 100 days the book is ready. 
The site stays alive until something peculiar happens. All the source will be in Github anyway, so it should be easy to maintain.
