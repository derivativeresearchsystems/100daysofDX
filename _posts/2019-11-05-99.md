First of all, all developers are worthy and skilfull. Some of them become hackers, the top 1% of software/hardware engineers. Hacker is what the media started to connect with negative stories in the past and built an image in our heads of somewhat criminal and dangerous person. Hacker term has originally been an honour. If someone called you a hacker you were considered talented, innovative (find novel solutions with things), quick learner, insightful and witty. 

<blockquote>To me top 1% of the engineers are hackers.</blockquote> 

They might be annoying occasionally mostly because they make me think things again often from different perspective and result to better outcome. 

Forbes wrote 2014 a story "[What The Top 1% Of Software Engineers Do That The Other 99% Do Not](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/10/08/what-the-top-1-of-software-engineers-do-that-the-other-99-do-not/#2dbd714f7637)" and listed some of the principles on what it takes to become that 1% of engineers. The story took mostly ideas from [Quora discussion](https://www.quora.com/What-do-the-top-1-of-software-engineers-do-that-the-other-99-do-not/) filled with comments from developers.
