## What I regret

Regret that I was not able to engage developers more to the discussions around the topics. That requires time and resources, but it was the best part without a doubt. 

## Would I do it again or recommend to others? 

Yes! and no... Be prepared that you will most likely have obstacles in writing every day. You will get sick or something else. It's 100 days and that it is a long time! Don't be too hard on yourself. If it requires to take a break, then do it and continue after that.
