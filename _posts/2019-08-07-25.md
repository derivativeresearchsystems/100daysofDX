Iâ€™ve read about 200 articles and books about APIs while trying to create solid fact based classification of APIs. Based on literature APIs can be divided to three major categories: Open Data Interfaces, Open APIs, Internal and Private APIs. The classification was initially created for the API Economy book published 2018 in Finnish and 2019 in English ().

## Why should I care?

Some have asked me if anyone else than technical people should understand APIs at all? Short answer is yes. Longer answer around the blog series. APIs should not be seen as technical - but as constructs. 

**API development driver should be the business.** Thus business development staff at your company should be well-aware of the opportunities APIs bring to grow your business and in some cases reduce cost structure. Your IT architects should see the benefits of APIs; flexible, agile and scalable architecture. 

But now the discussion has turned already away from technical nuances of APIs towards the value APIs can and should provide for Consumers. **In this context consumer refers to application developers, who are seen as the primary customer**, not the end-users using implemented applications.
