The words we use in our vocabulary shape our thinking and direction of thoughts. If we use technical terms even if it is not necessary, we push away the non-technical people and enforce the specific role of technical people in the domain. API Design is one of these domains. It has been dominated by technical language and required technical skills and specification (pedantic way) understanding. I mean to be able to make any API design you must have had ability to write code-ish machine-readable text files. 

## Spec-driven

Technical

## Contract-driven

As long as we do what the contract says we are cool. Right! 

## Design-Driven

By default design is about user experience and maximise it.
