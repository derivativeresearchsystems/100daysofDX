We all are confronted with the situation in which we have to expplain what API is to non-technical people. You can of course jump into technical approach but that in my experience leads to rolling eyes. That is because you will most likely use acronyms they have never heard of. Treating APIs as products also means you will include at least marketing and business layer in the team. They need to understand what API is and even the difference between API types.  

## Plug-n-play

Previously some people said that you can make an analogy between powerplug on the wall and API. With traditional REST API I was against it, although yes you could say so. Just plug it in and that's it. As a consumer you don't need to worry what happens behind the plug - it just works...if it does. There's also little you can do if the socket does not provide electricity. That's not in your hands. 


In pure REST consumer is the active part not only in connecting to "powersocket" but also in consumption. That is not the case with powersocket. You just plug the cord and electricity starts to flow. That reminds more like the streaming APIs, websockets and also websub pattern with APIs.
