Traditional B2C customer just install the app and use it. Or that is the desired result. The features in the app are naturally limited. If the app is a good one, it most likely fills in around 80% of the customer needs. That's good enough. The consumer can not adjust the app, they adjust their own behaviour or try to find an alternative. The alternative probably is better in something than the first, but most likely lacks something the first app was able to provide. 

Now the developers are not the same. You need to understand that...
