I've said it couple of times in the series, but APIs should not be build just because. Companies do not do it too often since waste of resources is waste of money. Public sector in Finland is building APIs (have been doing for years already) but the reason why and for who the APIs are build seems not to be the driver. I kind of understand that and now that the government is forced to provide machine-readable access to data, they are going to build even more APIs. 

Again the question is how to get started? Jumping into implementation or even in design process is not the way to get started. This applies to private and public sector alike. You need to know what is the purpose of the API. This is also where developer experience begins to build. It's not something that is added afterwardds, but it's there from day one. Or at least it should be. 

## Use canvas to find out pains and gains

No need to invent the wheel again in hundreds of offices. Use what has been offered for free and has been battle tested with plethora of APIs.
