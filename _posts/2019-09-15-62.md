Just recently the studies around http driven or "web APIs" has started to appear. Academic research is often lagging behind in some topics - this is one of those. The study of API usability has often focused on the programmers who use A​PIs in their own code, known as ​API Users.​ The developer experience (DX) is significantly impacted by the quality of the APIs they must use. However, **the usability that these programmers experience with an API ultimately stems from how well the API and its resources were designed in the first place**. Very little attention so far has been given to the API design processes or to the ​API designers who are making these design decisions.

You can ruin a API before you even start to implement it. Jumping straight to implementation is the mother of all fuck ups with APIs. A lot of people evangelise the technical best practices to gain great API and developer experience. I disagree. That is not where you ought to begin. Best practice requires testing an API with users early, even when the API is not yet implemented or even fully designed.

1. You should first understand why it will be built, what are the use cases, what are the painpoints it will solve/relieve (problem domain). 
2. Then you design it. (solution domain)
3. Test the design with actual consumers. If not possible, do the API Peer Review at least internally.
4. Then you think about the details of the implementation and scalability, fit to architecture etc. 
5. Then you implement it. (combining problem and solution domain)
6. Improve based on feedback

<blockquote>Great API design requires a lot more than great implementation, which is the manifestation of the wisdom gained in previous steps.</blockquote>  


## Skills and organisational practices

**API designers must have a strong understanding of software engineering**, but ​also have the ability and personal drive to stay focused on their user’s perspective as their primary goal.  API design is recognized as a difficult and specialized skill with few training resources, so more training material is needed. A good API designer needs an intuition for user experience, this may be trained by giving interested developers exposure to basic user experience testing and usability methods that have been well established in UX. 

The availability or lack of API designers, is twat easily results to non-optimal situations. Developers who are great at implementing the APIs also do the design. Occasionally that works well and depends of the developers ability to approach the design from consumers point of view. 

**API guidelines published online by various organizations are the primary authoritative source for design standards and practices.** API guidelines, which not all designers actually read the entirety of their company’s guidelines, use it as a general-purpose reference material to look up specific design questions as they arise. Designers often have multiple competing design concerns and constraints to balance during API design, making following ​all guidelines much harder than it might appear. Specifically, new designers struggle with knowing the relative importance of different guidelines, and must learn through mistakes when to adhere or deviate from a rule. 

Some companies enforced their API guidelines through the use of code reviews and “linter” tools that check for specific guideline requirements. The purpose of this enforcement is to ensure a base level of API usability across the company, and also ensure API users have a ​consistent experience if they use multiple APIs across the company to avoid each API having its own learning curve. 

Whomever designs the API is **responsible for figuring out their API users’ needs and keeping those needs central to the design process.** Ideally, API design should be done by an interdisciplinary team, however the challenge remains of teaching expert software engineers enough user-centered design and teaching expert UX designers enough software engineering that these two disciplines can work effectively together. 

Poor quality “bottom-up” API design occurs when, lacking real use case data, the engineering team designs around what is most straightforward to implement, which means that the API design mirrors much more the underlying ​implementation of the API than how customers want to use it. Before getting too far into construction details of the API (the things that are covered in API design guidelines) like naming, pagination, etc., it is critical to check your team’s understanding of the API’s real life client use cases, since it will often be difficult or impossible to change these later. This can be achieved by **getting users involved early on in the design process and continually obtaining feedback** from them throughout this process.

## Cornerstones of API design

According to research done by  [Stylos and Myers (2017)](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NatProg/papers/Stylos2007APIDesignDecisions.pdf) the basic qualities basic  qualities  of  an  API  are  its  **usability**  and  its  **power**. It must be noted that the mentioned research is about APIs in application level, not for example http driven APIs. Nevertheless the two qualities can be described as follows. 

Roughly, “usability”  refers  to  the  qualities  of  an  API  that  affect  its  use  when  creating  and  debugging  code,  while  “power”  refers to limits of the code that can be created. Usability  includes  such  attributes  as  how  easy  an  API is to learn; how productive programmers are using it;  how  an  API  prevents  errors;  how  simple  it  is;  how  consistent;  and  how  well  it  matches  its  users’  mental  models. 

Power  includes  an  API’s  expressiveness  (the  sorts  of  programs  it  can  create);  its  extensibility  (how  users  can  extend  the  API  to  create  convenient  user-specific components);  its  evolvability  for  the  API  designers  who  will  update  the  API  and  create  new  versions;  its  performance  (in terms  of  speed,  memory  and  other  resource  consumption);  and  the  robustness  and  bug-freeness of the API implementation. The  usability  mostly  affects  API  users,  though  the  error  prevention  affects  the  consumers  of  the  resulting  products.  The  power  affects  mostly  API  users  and  product consumers,though the evolvability affects API designers.

While   the   attributes   above   individually   affect   whether  and  how  users  adopt  an  API,  there  are  also  higher  level  issues  that  affect  adoption.  For  example,  one phenomenon is that of “death by 1000 paper cuts”: even if they do not have large problems, APIs  can be unusable because of many small ones, such as multiple minor lapses in consistency or simplicity. On the other hand,   a   positive   phenomenon   is   that   of   a   “self-documenting” API: this is an API with enough positive usability  attributes  that  users  can  figure  it  out  as  they  go,  and  rarely  if  ever  have  to  refer  to  the  documentation. The latter is the dream come true for all API providers. 

<blockquote>self-documenting API has enough positive usability  attributes  that  users  can  figure  it  out  as  they  go,  and  rarely  if  ever  have  to  refer  to  the  documentation</blockquote>

## Evaluate before implementation 

You can design API throughly anf try to make it perfect in the office. That rarely results to optimal solution. Running a usability study of a specific API before it is released, using programmers representative of the target audience and the most common programming tasks that the API is intended to support, is an effective technique for detecting non-obvious usability issues with APIs and improving the usability of the released APIs. ([Clarke, 2004](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/200086234_Measuring_API_usability)) 

The most obvious test is to involve the consumers to the process as it was discussed above. In higher level before the design should be evaluated with different approach. API Design Guides are manifestations of these higher level analysis and lessons-learned from the past.  

## What's the cognitive burden to use your API

Cognitive Dimensions Framework was designed to evaluate programming language environment usability, but has previously been adapted to evaluate API usability as well [3]. The cognitive dimensions framework for example measures simplicity via the dimension called work-step unit which is a measure of the quantity of user code required for a single unit of work, or step. 

http driven APIs are languages agnostic eg they are not normally designed to any specific programming language. Of course some of the design choices such as how lists and presented are easier to use in some programming languages. For example response set might be optimised for node driven apps. Now consider a new customer taking first steps with your API. The question is how much cognitive burden does it require to get started? Do they need to learn use of some framework libraries before they can use your API? Can they just call it as is? Some kind of basic skills in the selected programming language is expected (or has to be learned) to be able to call your API from it and then process the response which might contain list of objects and attributes. The more custom style of processing is needed the bigger is the burden.
