First of all: [Use HTTP status codes!](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/) but don't overuse them. most API providers use a small subset. For example, the Google GData API uses only 10 status codes; Netflix uses 9, and Digg, only 8. Otherwise great API can become hated due to obscure error messages. MrMurphy will make a visit to your house as well.  

Every API will fail occasionally and thus error messages must be good. Dispite of your excellent API documentation, developers might try to use your API with false options. Again, error messages to the rescue. 

When you boil it down, there are really only 3 outcomes in the interaction between an app and an API:
- Everything worked -  success 
- The application did something wrong – client error
- The API did something wrong – server error

Normally if everything goes fine, the response code 200 is returned in headers. There are differences though. According to some sources for example Facebook responds always 200 dispite something went "wrong". I would not know about that. I've never used Facebook APIs.

## Bad error messages waste everyone's time

[According to Nordic APIs](https://nordicapis.com/best-practices-api-error-handling/), a quality error code should include:

- An HTTP Status Code, so that the source and realm of the problem can be ascertained with ease
- An Internal Reference ID for documentation-specific notation of errors. In some cases, this can replace the HTTP Status Code, as long as the internal reference sheet includes the HTTP Status Code scheme or similar reference material.
- Human readable messages that summarize the context, cause, and general solution for the error at hand.

Twitter does a pretty good response: 

```

{"errors":[{"code":215,"message":"Bad Authentication data."}]}
```

The line ```HTTP/2 400 ``` tells us that error happened (Bad Request 400). Number 215 in the response body is the internal error code, with which I can use to seek for more information. I would have added there a link to documentation where the authentication is explained or link to error code (which in turn would link me to auth documentation).  

In summary, be verbose and use plain language descriptions. Add as many hints as your API team can think of about what's causing an error. I recommend you to add a link in your description to more information. That is what for example Twilio does. 

## Make use of the error situations

Of course wise API providers track and analyze the error situations in logs to pinpoint unintended usage of the API. Analyzing the errors you might find patterns and then based on what is learned change the API or iterate the documentation. 

Your logs and monitoring in general should naturally alert you when your code is failing too. The latter should not be common if you have done proper testing. Of course current services are often so complex systems that one minor change in one "distant" part might cause unintended changes elsewhere - for example in your API. 

Also make sure your API docs is uptodate so that your advises on the usage are not driving consumers towards errors. That is most irritating!
