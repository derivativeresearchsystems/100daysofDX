First of all: Use HTTP status codes! but don't overuse them. most API providers use a small subset. For example, the Google GData API uses only 10 status codes; Netflix uses 9, and Digg, only 8. Otherwise great API can become hated due to obscure error messages. MrMurphy will make a visit to your house as well.  

Every API will fail occasionally and thus error messages must be good. Dispite of your excellent API documentation, developers might try to use your API with false options. Again, error messages to the rescue. Of course wise API providers track and analyze the error situations in logs to pinpoint unintended usage of the API and then based on what is learned change the API or iterate the documentation.

When you boil it down, there are really only 3 outcomes in the interaction between an app and an API:
- Everything worked -  success 
- The application did something wrong – client error
- The API did something wrong – server error

## Bad error messages waste everyone's time

In summary, be verbose and use plain language descriptions. Add as many hints as your API team can think of about what's causing an error. I recommendyou to add a link in your description to more information. That is what for examplee Twilio does.
