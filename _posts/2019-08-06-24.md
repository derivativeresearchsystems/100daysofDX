You should not mix pricing plans to how customer is billed since for example customer may be using per API call plan, but billed once a month. Now it’s becoming more popular to have annual billing as an alternative. With annual billing you normally get a discount, but from providers perspective you have one more long term committed customer. It’s not a hard vendor-lock, but financially you will be committed to one provider for a year. Different pricing plans exists and occasionally some of them are combinations of basic forms discussed below. 

- Freemium, when there exists a limited basic plan and users can overtake the limits depending on they pay for the service, Sendgrid is an example here with 100 emails / day freemium. 
- Trial, instead of offering contant free use, you offer a trial period (7-30 days) after which consumer either becomes paying customer or not. You need to decide which pricing plan to go after the trial. 


Trial is used  (in apps) mostly because conversion rate in freemium is normally pretty low, only some percents. What ever pricing plan you decide to build, make sure it does not create unncessary hurdles for the developers. They need to learn first how your product works, how it can be utilized and what is the cost structure now and in the future. Lets have a look at the two models more thoroughly. 

## Trial

Because subscriptions are based on the association of a payment method with a plan, your customers must provide a payment method at the start of any subscription – even those that include a trial period before the first billing cycle. The day after the trial period ends, customers will be charged automatically for the subscription. Customers are not alerted by default when they enter the first billing cycle – you must be proactive to make sure your customers know that the trial period is ending and they will be charged soon.

The failure to alert the customer prior to their charge, or give them the option to opt-out, will result in something referred to as negative option billing. Negative option billing puts you at an increased risk of chargebacks, as customers may not be expecting this delayed charge.

Negative option billing is generally prohibited amongst banking partners. We strongly recommend you avoid this practice by notifying customers of the first billing date towards the end of their trial period. 

The auto-renewal without an email asking the customer if they want to renew a particular service might be legally OK, but is it ethically OK? Who can remember renewal dates for all of our subscriptions these days? I think it's disgraceful.

### Hooking

One of the customer hooking stategies in apps I've encountered is to offer paid service level first as a trial and then after it ends drop the user to freemium level. Provider hopes that I get frustrated with the lower level and start paying for it as a subcription. Other reason for this strategy is that provider hopes I get so accustomed to the service that I "can't survive without it". It become part of my daily life and I "need" the paid version. This is what Todoist does with their app. They also provide API, but it's not sold as a product. 

## Freemium 

With freemium you do not get the above mentioned shitty situatons. You just use the API and depending of the service provider you might be cut off from the service for a while (before new period begins) or you might experience slow or otherwise limited service (rate limiting). 

One of the biggest hurdles of trials (regardless of period length) seems to be the time boxed opportunity:

Luckily freemium does not equal advertisements. 

## Freemium is the way to go

From developer’s point of view trial might be a bit problematic. If you are building a service startup style and you have difficulties to grow own paying customer count, you end up to situation in which your costs start to climb. If all the APIs you use have just trial periods, then at given moment your costs rise at one point. In other words, trial does not offer a chance to select paid plan at the right moment for me, the customer. Instead it aims to dictate the schedule and serve API owners interests. 

The API consumer should be able to define exactly the right moment in time to get familiar with your product. Developer might be learning multiple APIs at the same time and for some reason not able to focus on your API with trial already activated. That kills the opportunity to learn your API without costs, which is now expected and default. Developers select not to register and activate trial at all unless it's mandatory API and in those cases it's a different game all together.
