We have created a API docs engine as part of the platform development. The input can be RAML or OAS files and the result is stripe style 3 column API docs with generated code examples for each endpoint and method for selected programming languages. The last part of it is expanding now to support more and more programming languages.  

As part of testing various Open API specs available in the web as feed for our API docs engine we have found out that a lot of them are not even valid....This was a shock to me. I would expect companies to validate the spec files before pushing public. What can you do with invalid spec files? 

For this purpose we have to add extra configuration option to the engine (which is going to sold as a service beginning next year). Option is `strict` or not. If strict is on, then we require valid input, if not, then we take what is given and hope for best possible result. 

I'm not sure if for example Postman "eats" invalid spec files but at least it does validate the input and report errors. No, it does not. I just tested it and result from reading in [Sendgrid's massive OAS file](https://github.com/sendgrid/sendgrid-oai/blob/master/oai.yaml) available at Github resulted to error and nothing was imported
