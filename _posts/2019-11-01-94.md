---

In the post [#32 "SLA from developerâ€™s point of view"](https://100daysdx.com/23/) I discussed briefly the current SLA practices which are more or less ridiculous. SLA is not defined in machine redable format and practically the only measure is availability "_Our SLA is 99.9% monthly_". After digging a little deeper I found and article describing machine readable SLA extension to Open API spec. The idea was introduced in the academic article and the spec with examples is also on Github. They even provide node example implementation. 

To me this is one of the signs that APIs are not fully treated as products. Yes, the technical nature of API is machine readable but the business aspects of it are not.
