The above has been easy to understand. While I’ve been giving API Economy talks in various local and international events, I have noticed that some of the audience have difficulties to understand the difference between Application (app), API and Integration.

Since APIs have taken a significant role in service development, it’s no surprise that the amount of public APIs has been growing rapidly since 2014. APIs are sometimes seen more as products per se and sold to developers from stores much like average Joe or Jane buys applications from Appstore or Google Play. **APIs have become commodities for application developers. This has lead to the birth of API Economy.** ([Moilanen et al.](https://www.amazon.com/API-Economy-101-Jarkko-Moilanen/dp/9528008496))   

But all APIs are not only sold as procucts as is. Some of the APIs are not sold at all as it was discussed above. APIs are also often additional components of SaaS model services. For example data is not manipulated only with help of graphical user inteface such as browser, but also with APIs. APIs are used often in parallel with GUIs. GUI is for humans and APIs are for machines and applications. APIs are preferred and effective tool in automated data manipulation. Still the question of value API should provide has been untouched.
